# azure-powershell
This is a conglomeration of Powershell scripts that can be used in an Azure environment for reporting and modification purposes.
- Will be adding scripts as I have time to upload/create them. Have around 20 scripts that need to be uploaded currently. Will upload larger ones first.

Note: Will be converting most of the code in these programs to functions.
